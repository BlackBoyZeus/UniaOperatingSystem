# Contributing to TALD UNIA

## Introduction

### Project Overview
TALD UNIA is a revolutionary handheld gaming platform built on FreeBSD 9.0, integrating real-time LiDAR scanning, mesh networking, and AI-driven features for immersive mixed-reality gaming experiences. The platform supports fleet-based multiplayer gaming for up to 32 concurrent devices.

### Development Philosophy
We prioritize performance, security, and scalability across all components while maintaining strict latency requirements for real-time gaming experiences. All contributions must align with our core performance targets and security standards.

### Code of Conduct
All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

### Component Architecture Overview
- LiDAR Core (C++/CUDA): Environmental scanning and processing
- Fleet Manager (Rust): P2P mesh networking and state synchronization
