# TALD UNIA Platform

A revolutionary handheld gaming platform integrating real-time LiDAR scanning, mesh networking, and AI-driven features for immersive mixed-reality gaming experiences.

## Overview

TALD UNIA is a cutting-edge gaming platform built on a custom FreeBSD-based operating system that enables seamless interaction between physical and virtual environments. Supporting fleet-based multiplayer gaming for up to 32 concurrent devices, it delivers unparalleled mixed-reality experiences through:

- 30Hz LiDAR scanning with 0.01cm resolution and 5-meter range
- WebRTC-based mesh networking with <50ms latency
- Vulkan 1.3-based rendering with edge computing optimization
- TensorRT 8.6 AI acceleration for enhanced gameplay
- CRDT-based state synchronization for reliable multiplayer
