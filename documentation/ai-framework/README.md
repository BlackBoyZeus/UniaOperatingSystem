## Integration Points

### Game Engine Integration

The AI Framework integrates with the UNIA Game Engine through several interfaces:

```cpp
// Example of AI Framework integration with game logic
#include "unia/ai_framework.h"

class AIGameController {
private:
    unia::ai::InferenceEngine* inferenceEngine;
    unia::ai::NPCSystem* npcSystem;
    
public:
    AIGameController() {
        // Initialize AI components
        inferenceEngine = unia::ai::InferenceEngine::getInstance();
        npcSystem = new unia::ai::NPCSystem(inferenceEngine);
    }
    
    void update(float deltaTime) {
        // Update all NPCs using the AI system
        npcSystem->update(deltaTime, gameWorld);
    }
    
    void handlePlayerAction(const PlayerAction& action) {
        // Feed player actions to the learning system
        npcSystem->observePlayerAction(action);
    }
};
```

### Sensor Processing Integration

The AI Framework works closely with the Sensor Processing layer:

```cpp
// Example of AI processing sensor data
#include "unia/ai_framework.h"
#include "unia/sensor_processing.h"

class AIPerceptionSystem {
private:
    unia::ai::InferenceEngine* inferenceEngine;
    unia::sensor::LiDARProcessor* lidarProcessor;
    
public:
    AIPerceptionSystem() {
        inferenceEngine = unia::ai::InferenceEngine::getInstance();
        lidarProcessor = unia::sensor::LiDARProcessor::getInstance();
    }
    
    void processEnvironment() {
        // Get processed point cloud from LiDAR
        auto pointCloud = lidarProcessor->getLatestPointCloud();
        
        // Use AI to identify objects in the environment
        auto objects = inferenceEngine->runInference(
            "object_detection",
            pointCloud
        );
        
        // Update game world with detected objects
        updateGameWorld(objects);
