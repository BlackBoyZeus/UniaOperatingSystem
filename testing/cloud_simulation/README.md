# UNIA OS Cloud Testing Infrastructure

This directory contains the cloud testing infrastructure for the UNIA Operating System, designed to validate its performance and compatibility with next-generation gaming console hardware profiles.

## Overview

The cloud testing infrastructure allows us to:

1. Simulate various hardware configurations that match potential console specifications
2. Run performance benchmarks across different hardware profiles
3. Test AI capabilities under various load conditions
4. Validate mesh networking performance with simulated player counts
5. Generate reports on system stability and performance metrics

## Directory Structure

- `config/` - Hardware simulation configuration files
- `scripts/` - Test automation scripts
- `results/` - Test result storage and analysis tools
- `reports/` - Generated performance reports
- `benchmarks/` - Performance benchmark definitions

## Getting Started

To run the cloud testing infrastructure:

1. Configure your AWS credentials
2. Deploy the testing infrastructure using the provided CloudFormation template
3. Run the test suite using the command: `./run_tests.sh`
4. View results in the generated reports directory

## Hardware Profiles

The testing infrastructure includes simulation profiles for various hardware configurations:

- **Standard Console** - Baseline configuration similar to current-gen consoles
- **High-Performance Console** - Configuration matching expected next-gen hardware
- **AI-Optimized Console** - Configuration with enhanced AI processing capabilities
- **Network-Optimized Console** - Configuration with enhanced networking capabilities

## Test Categories

- **Performance Tests** - CPU, GPU, and memory utilization under various game scenarios
- **AI Behavior Tests** - Testing of AI subsystems and behavior trees
- **Networking Tests** - Mesh networking performance with various player counts
- **Stability Tests** - Long-running tests to validate system stability
- **Resource Utilization** - Tests to measure resource usage efficiency

## Integration with CI/CD

The cloud testing infrastructure is integrated with our CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests on each commit to the main branch.
