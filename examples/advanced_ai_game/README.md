# Advanced AI Game Example

This example demonstrates a more complex game that leverages the full capabilities of the UNIA AI Core, including:

- Advanced NPC behaviors using sophisticated behavior trees
- Procedural terrain generation with AI-driven feature placement
- Player modeling with machine learning
- Multiplayer support with CRDT-based state synchronization
- Power management optimization for mobile devices

## Overview

The Advanced AI Game is a sandbox-style game where players can explore a procedurally generated world populated with intelligent NPCs. The game adapts to the player's behavior and preferences, creating a personalized experience.

## Key Features

### AI-Driven NPCs

NPCs in the game use advanced behavior trees to make decisions based on:

- Environmental context (time of day, weather, nearby objects)
- Player interactions and relationship history
- Individual personality traits and goals
- Emotional states that evolve over time

NPCs can:
- Form memories of player interactions
- Develop relationships with the player and other NPCs
- Learn from observing player behavior
- Adapt their strategies based on success/failure

### Procedural World Generation

The world is generated using:

- Multi-layered noise functions for realistic terrain
- AI-driven biome placement based on climate models
- Erosion simulation for natural-looking landscapes
- Intelligent feature placement (villages, dungeons, resources)
- Dynamic weather and time systems that affect gameplay

### Player Modeling

The game builds a model of each player to:

- Identify play style preferences (explorer, achiever, socializer, killer)
- Predict player engagement and satisfaction
- Recommend content based on player preferences
- Adjust difficulty dynamically based on player skill
- Generate personalized quests and challenges

### Multiplayer Features

Players can:

- Explore the world together with up to 32 concurrent players
- Interact with shared NPCs and environments
- Collaborate on building and resource gathering
- Engage in cooperative or competitive activities
- Experience consistent game state through CRDT synchronization

### System Optimization

The game optimizes system resources by:

- Adjusting AI complexity based on available processing power
- Scaling graphics quality to maintain frame rate
- Implementing power-saving features for mobile devices
- Using efficient memory management for large worlds
- Distributing AI workloads across multiple cores

## Technical Implementation

The game is built using:

- UNIA AI Core for NPC behavior and player modeling
- UNIA Graphics Engine for rendering
- UNIA Networking Layer for multiplayer
- FreeBSD kernel integration for optimal performance
- Power management for mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- UNIA Operating System
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- GPU with Vulkan support
- Network connection for multiplayer

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ultrabrainai/UniaOperatingSystem.git
cd UniaOperatingSystem

# Build the example
cd examples/advanced_ai_game
cargo build --release

# Run the game
cargo run --release
```

### Controls

- WASD: Movement
- Mouse: Look around
- E: Interact
- Tab: Inventory
- M: Map
- T: Chat (multiplayer)
- Esc: Menu

## Development

The example is structured to showcase different aspects of the UNIA AI Core:

- `src/npc/`: NPC behavior implementation
- `src/world/`: Procedural world generation
- `src/player/`: Player modeling and adaptation
- `src/networking/`: Multiplayer implementation
- `src/systems/`: Game systems and mechanics
